   Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. 


How does cybersecurity work?

Network security:
                   Uses firewalls, anti-virus, and other technologies to protect networks from cyberattacks 

Application security:
                   Develops security features into applications to prevent unauthorized access and modification 

Patch management:
                   Applies updates to systems to fix vulnerabilities and protect against cyberattacks 

Anti-virus software:
                   Detects and removes threats

Types of cyberattacks:

Phishing:
           Uses fraudulent communications to trick people into sharing sensitive data or downloading malware 

Ransomware:
           A type of malware that encrypts data and demands a ransom to decrypt it 

Cybersecurity examples: 
          Using strong passwords, Installing and maintaining anti-virus software, Keeping systems updated, and Using data loss prevention (DLP) software. 

Cybersecurity goal:
The goal of cybersecurity is to protect systems and networks from digital attacks that could lead to financial loss, data theft, or business disruption.
